Final notebook published for Tabular Playground Series October 2022

This notebook documents my work throughout Tabular Playground Series competition. The main objective is to collect ideas, different approaches, difficulties faced and briefly explain my thought process around this challenge. It is also an invitation to review the challenge and think about what was done correctly, what kind of mistakes were made and what could have been done in a different way in order to get better results.
