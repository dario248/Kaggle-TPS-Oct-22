2. EDA\n\nComments and dataset first impressions are presented in this notebook: [TPS-Oct22-Dataset First Impressions](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dariopaez/tps-oct22-dataset-first-impressions).\n\nBesides, these works have great information and insights about this challenge data:\n- [🚀 TPS Oct 22 - Rocket League EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samuelcortinhas/tps-oct-22-rocket-league-eda/notebook#3.-EDA)  by Samuel Cortinhas\n- [TPS OCT 2022 - EDA + Simple Models](https://www.kaggle.com/code/craigmthomas/tps-oct-2022-eda-simple-models/notebook) by Craig Thomas \n\nThese presents a great exploratory analysis. \n\nFrom EDA we can extract some general conclusions:\n\n- Dataset needs to be compressed\n- Target is unbalanced (90% for no team scoring, 5% for team A scoring and 5% for team B scoring)\n- Missing values that needs to be filled are associated to players position, velocity and booster remaining\n\n\nAfter these first impressions I tried different approaches to balance the data. These are shown [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dariopaez/tps-oct22-dataset-first-impressions). Then, I spent quite some time trying different models and parameters using the new balanced dataset. However, these models gave me bad results despite changing their structure and parameters. Since competition submission are evaluated by LogLoss, better results were obtained without modifying the data distribution and, probably, the test set distribution is similar to the train set. This explanation is better explained and detailed in this work: [How to kill all your efforts? ](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexryzhkov/how-to-kill-all-your-efforts) by Alexander Ryzhkov. Thanks to his work I finally understood that I was wasting time and needed to take a different approach. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3. Data Processing\n\nFeature engineering and data compression were handled together: [TPS-Oct22-Data compression and FE](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dariopaez/tps-oct22-data-compression-and-fe). Through an iteration over the training set and saving each file into the compressed feather format. \n\n### Feature Engineering\nSome added features included:\n\n- Distance between Ball and both goals\n- Ball speed\n- Players speed\n- Distance between team A players and team B goal\n- Distance between team B players and team A goal\n- Players to ball distance\n\nDropped columns:\n\n- 'team_scoring_next'\n- 'player_scoring_next'\n- 'event_time'\n- 'event_id'\n- 'game_num'\n\n### Missing Values \n\nAfter trying different ideas to fill missing values I ended up filling all values with 0. Other approaches did not present noticeable better results and replacing with zeros was easier. \n\nIn brief, when a player is demolished, his position, speed and remaining booster is set to 0 as if the player is in the center of the field. \n\n### Useful notebooks\n\n- Another compressing solution using Dask: [🚀How to load 21M rows in 1 minute using 2 lines](https://www.kaggle.com/code/donatoriccio/how-to-load-21m-rows-in-1-minute-using-2-lines) by Donatio Riccio\n\n- FE and compressing with feather: [TPS-OCT-2022 - Simple TF](https://www.kaggle.com/code/eavelardev/tps-oct-2022-simple-tf/notebook) by Eduardo Avelar","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4. Model\n\nModel with best result achieved has the following features:\n\n- Compressed dataset in feather format\n- Added computed distances and speed features \n- Missing values replaced by 0s \n- Data transformation to make each column distribution to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1\n- 4 Dense layers with Relu activation\n- Added Normalization and Dropout layers\n- 2 Output dense neurons with sigmoid activation\n\nDespite **compressing** the data, I could not train a model with the whole dataset without running **out of memory**. Because of that, I made a loop to mix 5% samples from each train file and use that **mixed file** to train each model. With another loop, I generated different versions of that mixed train file and train several models. After training for one epoch I used the model to make predictions on the test set and saved results into csv files. The idea was to compute the mean of several predictions and analyze if that process gave better results than training only one model for more epochs.

6. Final Comments\n\n- I didn´t try **Data augmentation** solutions like:\n - Shuffle players in the same team\n - Flipping X axis (symmetrical)\n - Mirror Team A and Team B\n \n \n Some of these solutions could be applied with a custom Data Generator from Keras in this notebook: [TPS October 2022 - Keras/TF Neural Network](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fabianbong/tps-october-2022-keras-tf-neural-network) by Fabian Bong\n \n- Since training data was grouped by game and event, a correct way to split into train and validation sets would be using Group K Fold. This is explained here: [➡️Understanding the data + why you need GroupKFold](https://www.kaggle.com/code/donatoriccio/understanding-the-data-why-you-need-groupkfold) by Donato Riccio.\n\n- Calibration to correct the effect of sampling data:\n[Calibration is all you need!](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexryzhkov/calibration-is-all-you-need/notebook) by Alexander Ryzhkov\n","metadata":{}}]}
